# Ecco - a small python HTTP server
## About
Ecco is a simple (and probably stupid :P) HTTP server written in Python for learning purposes.  
This is my first ever attempt to work on anything so closely related to sockets/HTTP/peer-to-peer communication.
Please excuse any stupid errors I that might have committed  and, if it's worth your time, please send me any positive criticism at [my email address](mailto:gabriele@gabrielecirulli.com).  

**Fun fact:** "ecco" means "here it is" in Italian, my mother tongue.

## Status
**18/01/2012** - Ecco is still incomplete and non-functional at the moment. Hopefully I'll have the have time to work on it and bring it to a point where it can take part in some real serving action, but right now it does nothing more than binding itself to a socket and analysing (probably the wrong way, too) an incoming HTTP request.
